# Afame Technologies Internship Projects

## Introduction
This repository contains the projects completed during my Data Analyst Internship at Afame Technologies. The internship involved working on three projects focusing on sales data analysis, HR data analysis, and Titanic survival prediction.

## Projects Overview
1. **Sales Data Analysis**: Analyzed a sizable sales dataset to identify patterns, best-selling items, and revenue indicators to assist in business decision-making.
2. **HR Data Analysis**: Cleansed HR data by removing unnecessary columns, renaming columns, eliminating redundant entries, and sanitizing specific columns.
3. **Titanic Survival Prediction**: Built a machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using available dataset features.
